/*

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palin- drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat". "atco cta". etc.) Hints: #106, #121, #134, #136


Thought process for MVP:

- split string into a char array
- iterate through the char array, counting how many times each character appears
- if there's more than one letter that's in the string that appears an odd number of times, it can't be a palindrome
